 rex_swedish_nobility_reform_desc:0 "The Swedish Monarchy lacked the typical structure seen with the Feudal states of Europe at the time. The land owners and estates resisted any over-reaching from the Monarch and preferred that they remained focused on foreign affairs such as the expansion of the state. The result was land owners and estates handled their own affairs while the Monarch relied on conquest to strengthen their own control and power as head of state."
